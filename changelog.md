# pending features
1. implement fetching single client (useClientById, same way as useInvoiceById)
4. Refactor/organize based on [slide for Week 5 Office Hour 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pLZ8Zvpyr_myotpvyVYzY5awpUFUO78DE5CnBnVNm7c/edit#slide=id.g117828bad90_0_9)
5. latest client invoices in profile (link menu item from client table)
6. deprecate the use of anything with useClientSelector( and useInvoiceSelector(

# unknown bugs: 
- sometimes clients are not being loaded
# known bugs:
- if you are in page 10, and filter by client, filters are applied but page is still 10 (unexistant).
- adding a clients will not keep the client selector sorted.

# extra features:
- automatic configurable due-date amount of days
- add email, phone
- taxes to invoices?
- soft deletion?
- sorted filters? currently api will sort always in the same order. 
  it would be nice to give the user the control of choosing which sorting
  comes first.
